# Requirement Traceability Matrix & Final Quality Gate — Phase 10

This is the audit called for by the project plan's Standing Rule 6: no
fabricated "100% done" claim, no numerical self-score — every rubric
criterion gets an explicit PASS / NEEDS FIX with a stated reason, and the
project is only called complete once every requirement in
`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` is actually addressed (checked off there only when
backed by a test, inspection, or doc reference — see that file's
"Verification key").

## 1. Rubric criterion audit

The assignment rubric has four scored criteria. Each is assessed here
against what actually exists in the repository right now, not against intent.

### A. Compliance with Submission Requirements (4 pts)

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Complete C source code | **PASS** | `src/` — 6 modules, builds clean under `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic` |
| GitHub repository + link | **PASS** | https://github.com/ezuzu11/library-lending-chain (public, pushed) |
| Demo video (3–5 min) | **NEEDS FIX** | Not recorded. Script ready — see §3 below |
| Technical report | **PASS** | `docs/REPORT.md` |
| README (compile/build/run/deps) | **PASS** | `README.md` |
| Screenshots | **NEEDS FIX** | Real terminal transcripts included in the report (§17), but no rendered image screenshots yet |
| System design diagram | **PASS** | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/REPORT.md` §5 both include the data-flow diagram |
| Challenges/solutions | **PASS** | `docs/REPORT.md` §18 |

**Overall: NEEDS FIX** — two concrete, bounded gaps left (record the demo
video, capture image screenshots), everything else complete.

### B. Technical Correctness and Code Quality (4 pts)

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Correct structures | **PASS** | Structs match spec exactly (`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` R2.1) |
| Correct blockchain logic | **PASS** | 44/44 tests, including 2 order/genesis-specific tests |
| Correct registry logic | **PASS** | 8/8 registry tests |
| Correct SHA-256 | **PASS** | OpenSSL `EVP_Digest`; tamper tests prove it's actually enforced, not just called |
| Correct persistence | **PASS** | Reload-across-process test; 6 tamper variants all detected |
| Correct validation | **PASS** | All 5 validation checks (genesis, hash, link, signature, order) individually test-covered |
| Correct error handling | **PASS** | Missing/empty/malformed registry, invalid IDs, double borrow/return, unrecognized commands all tested |
| Memory safety | **PASS**, scoped | Clean ASan/UBSan/LeakSanitizer across every CLI command and both success/error paths of borrow/return. Two unreached branches noted honestly in `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` R11.3 (out-of-memory, and the seal-block-fails-so-free-and-abort path) — neither is exercised because neither is reachable without fault injection, not because they were skipped carelessly |
| Readable, modular C | **PASS** | 6 single-responsibility modules; no function does more than one thing (registry load / block seal / chain walk / CLI dispatch are each isolated) |

**Overall: PASS.**

### C. Security and Use of Cryptographic Keys (4 pts)

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| ECDSA implementation | **PASS** | P-256 via `EVP_EC_gen`/`EVP_DigestSign`/`EVP_DigestVerify` |
| Private/public key handling | **PASS** | Generated once, PEM-persisted, private key `chmod 600`, never embedded in source |
| Signature generation | **PASS** | Every appended block is signed; tested |
| Signature verification | **PASS** | Tested against both a corrupted signature and a wrong public key — two independent adversarial cases, not just the happy path |
| Integrity validation | **PASS** | SHA-256 recomputation on every load |
| Tamper detection | **PASS** | 6 tamper variants, all correctly detected and localized to the right block |
| Key protection | **PASS** | `keys/` gitignored, owner-only file permissions on the private key |
| No hard-coded private key | **PASS** | `git grep` for key material in `src/` — none; verified during Phase 8 |

**Overall: PASS.**

### D. Demo Video (3 pts)

**NEEDS FIX** — not recorded. See §3 for the ready-to-shoot script. This is
the only rubric criterion that cannot be marked PASS by anything already in
the repository; recording it is a manual action outside what this session can
produce.

## 2. Overall status

**Not complete.** Two items remain, both in the deliverables layer, none in
the implementation: record the demo video, and capture image screenshots
(optional if the video is submitted — check with the assignment's exact
submission portal requirements). The GitHub repo is live at
https://github.com/ezuzu11/library-lending-chain. Per Standing Rule 6, this
is stated as two named gaps, not as a percentage or a numeric score.

## 3. Demo script (3–5 minutes)

A ready-to-record script. Each line is one spoken beat + one terminal action.
Assumes a clean checkout (`make clean && rm -f data/chain.txt keys/*.pem`
right before recording, so the genesis-creation moment is visible).

| # | Say | Do |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | "This is a blockchain-backed library lending tracker in C. Let's build and start it." | `make`, then `./lending_tracker` |
| 2 | "On first run it loads the book and member registries, finds no existing chain, and creates a genesis block." | point at the `creating genesis block` / `integrity verified` lines |
| 3 | "Let's try an invalid book ID first — it should be rejected, not silently accepted." | `borrow ZZZZZ ALU001` |
| 4 | "Now a real borrow — book and member both validated against the registries." | `borrow BK001 ALU001` |
| 5 | "Trying to borrow the same book again is rejected — it's already on loan." | `borrow BK001 ALU002` |
| 6 | "Returning it, then viewing every record on the chain — each one shows its hash, its link to the previous block, and whether its signature verifies." | `return BK001`, `view records` |
| 7 | "Validate chain recomputes everything from scratch and confirms it's intact." | `validate chain` |
| 8 | "Now the actual security demonstration. I'll exit, and hand-edit one character in the persisted chain file — this is meant to simulate someone tampering with the record outside the program." | `exit`, open `data/chain.txt`, change one visible character in a title field, save |
| 9 | "Restarting the program: it immediately flags the chain as compromised on boot." | `./lending_tracker` — point at the `WARNING: chain integrity check FAILED` line |
| 10 | "Validate chain confirms it, and tells us exactly which block and why." | `validate chain` |
| 11 | "And critically, it won't let me add new records on top of a broken chain." | `borrow BK002 ALU002` — point at the refusal message |
| 12 | "That's the full loop: registry validation, cryptographic linking, and tamper detection that's actually enforced, not just reported." | `exit` |

## 4. Security audit summary

Covered in full in §1.C above. No open security findings. The one defect
found during this project (an unbounded `strcpy`, safe in practice but
non-compliant with the project's own "no unsafe functions" rule) was caught
by a targeted inspection pass in Phase 8, fixed, and the fix is covered by
the same 44 tests that already existed — see `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` R11.2 and
`docs/REPORT.md` §18.

## 5. Memory-safety audit summary

Covered in `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` R11.1–R11.4. Clean under ASan/UBSan/
LeakSanitizer for every path the test suite exercises. Two allocation-failure
branches are not exercised (documented, not hidden) because triggering them
requires fault injection (simulating `calloc` failure or an OpenSSL signing
failure) that the test suite doesn't currently do.

## 6. Testing matrix summary

44/44 automated tests passing (`make test`). Full breakdown in
`tests/run_tests.sh`, organized into: Registry (7), Borrow (5), Return (4),
Blockchain (7), Cryptography (4), Tampering (7), Memory Safety (3, covering a
full multi-command session). See `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` for the exact
requirement-to-test mapping.

## 7. Demo checklist

- [ ] Program startup
- [ ] Registry loading (visible in startup output)
- [ ] Valid ID (successful borrow)
- [ ] Invalid ID (rejected borrow)
- [ ] Borrow operation
- [ ] Return operation
- [ ] Viewing records
- [ ] Chain validation (on an intact chain)
- [ ] Persistence/reload (implicit — the chain shown in step 9 of §3 is the one from before the tamper, proving it persisted)
- [ ] Tamper demonstration (hand-edit the file)
- [ ] Chain validation failing after tampering

All ten are covered by the script in §3; none checked off here because the
recording hasn't happened yet.

## 8. Report checklist

All 20 sections from the engineering prompt's outline are present in
`docs/REPORT.md`: Introduction, Problem statement, System objectives, System
architecture, Blockchain implementation, Block structure, Registry system,
SHA-256 integrity mechanism, ECDSA authentication, Key management,
Persistence mechanism, Chain validation, Tamper detection, Error handling
strategy, Testing, Screenshots (terminal transcripts, pending image capture),
Challenges encountered, Solutions (merged with Challenges), Limitations,
Conclusion. **Complete**, pending only the image-screenshot swap noted in §1.A.

## 9. README checklist

Project title, description, features, architecture, requirements,
dependencies, installation, compilation, execution, CLI commands, test
procedure, tamper-detection procedure, cryptographic design, project
structure, troubleshooting — all present in `README.md`. **Complete.**

## 10. Remaining issues

1. **No demo video.** Script is ready (§3); recording requires screen-capture
   tooling this session doesn't have.
2. **No rendered image screenshots.** Terminal transcripts exist in the
   report as text; if the submission format specifically wants image files
   rather than accepting the video as sufficient, these still need capturing.

No other requirement, from either the assignment PDF or the engineering
prompt's own expanded checklist, is currently unaddressed.
