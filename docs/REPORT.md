# Technical Report — Library Lending Chain

## 1. Introduction

This report documents the design and implementation of a blockchain-based
library book lending tracker, built for the assignment "Design and
Implementation of a Blockchain-Based Library Book Lending Tracker." The system
replaces a mutable paper/database lending log with an append-only,
cryptographically verifiable chain of borrow/return records, so that neither a
librarian nor a borrower can quietly alter what actually happened.

## 2. Problem statement

Traditional library lending records live in a table or file that can be
edited after the fact — a librarian can mark a lost book "returned," or a
borrower can dispute what a paper log shows, and there's no way to prove
which version is authentic. The assignment asks for a system where every
lending event is recorded in a way that makes silent alteration detectable.

## 3. System objectives

1. Understand and implement a basic blockchain data structure in C.
2. Use SHA-256 to make block tampering detectable.
3. Use ECDSA digital signatures to authenticate who/what produced each block.
4. Validate book/member identities against file-based registries before any
   lending action is recorded.
5. Persist the chain across program runs, safely — never trusting persisted
   data without re-verifying it.
6. Apply defensive error handling throughout (missing files, malformed input,
   invalid IDs, invalid commands).

## 4. Spec inconsistency — noted, not silently followed

The assignment's Block Structure table labels this an "attendance chain" and
uses the field name `Member_name` (capitalized, inconsistent with the
otherwise snake_case fields). Every actual functional requirement — the
objectives, the description, Borrow/Return/Validate/View — describes a
**library lending** system, not attendance tracking. This is almost certainly
leftover wording copied from a different assignment template.

**Resolution:** the system is implemented and documented throughout as a
library lending chain, with the field named `member_name` (lowercase, for
consistency with `book_id`, `member_id`, etc.). This is flagged here
explicitly rather than either blindly copying the inconsistent wording or
silently "fixing" it without a note, per the project's working rules.

## 5. System architecture

```
books.txt ──► registry.c ──┐
                             ├──► blockchain.c ──► crypto.c (SHA-256 + ECDSA)
members.txt ─► registry.c ─┘            │
                                         ▼
                                  persistence.c ──► data/chain.txt
```

Six modules, each with one responsibility (full rationale in
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`):

| Module | Owns |
|---|---|
| `registry.c/h` | Book/Member structs, file loading, ID lookup |
| `crypto.c/h` | SHA-256 hashing, ECDSA keygen/sign/verify (OpenSSL EVP) |
| `blockchain.c/h` | Block/chain structs, genesis, append, borrow/return rules, validation |
| `persistence.c/h` | On-disk format, save, load, corruption detection |
| `cli.c/h` | Command parsing, dispatch, user-facing messages |
| `main.c` | Startup sequence: load registries → load/create chain → validate → run CLI |

This mirrors the project structure suggested in the engineering prompt, with
one deliberate deviation: there is no separate `validation.c` module.
Validation logic (registry line validation, chain validation) lives directly
inside the module that owns the data being validated (`registry.c`,
`blockchain.c`) rather than in a cross-cutting module, since in practice each
validation routine is tightly coupled to one data structure's invariants and
splitting it out added indirection without adding clarity.

## 6. Blockchain implementation

The chain is a singly linked list of `Block` structs (`Blockchain.head` /
`.tail` / `.length`), as the assignment's design guidance specifies. Each
block is heap-allocated (`calloc`) and freed exactly once, either individually
on an aborted append (e.g. a signing failure) or via `blockchain_free()`
walking the whole list at shutdown.

Appending a block (`borrow`/`return`/genesis) always follows the same
sequence: allocate → fill fields → serialize the hashable fields → SHA-256 →
ECDSA-sign the hash → link into the chain → return to the caller, who then
persists the chain to disk. This sequence is identical for genesis, borrow,
and return blocks — only the field values differ.

## 7. Block structure

```c
typedef struct Block {
    int index;
    time_t timestamp;
    char book_id[20];
    char book_title[80];
    char member_id[20];
    char member_name[50];
    char action[10];             /* BORROWED, RETURNED, (OVERDUE — unused, see §14) */
    char previous_hash[65];
    unsigned char signature[72]; /* ECDSA DER signature */
    char hash[65];

    size_t sig_len;   /* in-memory only — see §9 */
    struct Block *next;
} Block;
```

This matches the assignment's field list exactly (aside from the
`member_name` casing correction in §4), plus one in-memory-only addition
explained in §9.

## 8. Registry system

`books.txt`/`members.txt` are loaded once at startup into fixed-size arrays
(`MAX_BOOKS`/`MAX_MEMBERS` = 256, generous for a lab dataset). Loading is
defensive: each line is split on `,`, checked for exactly 3 fields and for
each field fitting its target buffer, and a bad line is skipped with a
warning rather than aborting the whole load or overflowing a buffer. The
registry is read-only for the program's lifetime — borrow/return only ever
query it (`registry_find_book`/`registry_find_member`), never mutate it.

## 9. SHA-256 integrity mechanism

Hashing covers every block field **except** `signature` and `hash` itself:
`index, timestamp, book_id, book_title, member_id, member_name, action,
previous_hash`, serialized into one delimited buffer and passed through
OpenSSL's `EVP_Digest` (SHA-256), producing a 64-character lowercase hex
string stored in `hash`.

**Why changing block data invalidates the hash:** `hash` is a pure function
of the other fields. If any hashed field changes after the block was written,
recomputing SHA-256 over the (now different) serialized buffer produces a
different digest than what's stored — `blockchain_validate` catches this by
recomputing and comparing on every load.

**Why changing an earlier block breaks later blocks too:** each block's
`previous_hash` was fixed at append time to the *pre-tamper* hash of its
predecessor. Changing block *N* changes what `hash` block *N* recomputes to —
but block *N+1*'s `previous_hash` still holds the old value, so the linkage
check (`previous_hash` must equal the prior block's recomputed `hash`) fails
at block *N+1* even if block *N+1* itself was never touched. Tampering
propagates forward through the chain by construction.

## 10. ECDSA authentication

A single ECDSA P-256 keypair, generated once via `EVP_EC_gen("P-256")` and
persisted as PEM files (`keys/private.pem`, `keys/public.pem`). Each block's
`hash` (not the raw fields, and not a re-hash of the whole block) is what
gets signed, via `EVP_DigestSign`; verification uses `EVP_DigestVerify`
against the public key and never treats an error as "valid" (fail-closed).

This is a second, independent check on top of hashing: even in the
(cryptographically infeasible) case of two different field sets producing the
same SHA-256 digest, the signature would only verify against the digest it
was actually produced for.

## 11. Key management

- Generated once at first startup if `keys/private.pem`/`keys/public.pem`
  don't both already exist; reused on every subsequent run.
- Private key file permissions restricted to the owner (`chmod 600`) at
  creation.
- Never embedded in source, never logged, never printed by any CLI path.
- `keys/` is gitignored — key material is runtime-generated, not shipped.

## 12. Persistence mechanism

Plain-text, one block per line, `|`-delimited:

```
index|timestamp|book_id|book_title|member_id|member_name|action|previous_hash|signature_hex|hash
```

Chosen over a raw binary struct dump specifically to sidestep struct padding,
endianness, and fixed-width-type portability concerns entirely — the file is
portable and human-editable, which also happens to make the required
tamper-detection demo trivial to perform and explain (open the file, change a
visible character, save).

Loading is split into two independently-testable concerns: `persistence_load`
only checks the file's *shape* (right number of fields, each within its
length limit, numeric fields actually numeric) and rejects anything that
doesn't parse safely as `PERSIST_CORRUPT`; `blockchain_validate`, run
separately right after a successful load, is what actually re-derives and
checks every hash/link/signature. This keeps "can I safely read this file at
all" separate from "is what's in this file trustworthy."

## 13. Chain validation

`blockchain_validate` walks the chain once, in order, checking per block:

1. Genesis correctness (`index == 0`, `previous_hash` = 64 zeros) — implicitly, as block 0's expected previous hash.
2. `index` matches the expected sequential position.
3. `previous_hash` matches the prior block's (recomputed) `hash`.
4. Recomputed SHA-256 matches the stored `hash`.
5. ECDSA signature verifies against the stored `hash`.

It stops and reports the *first* problem found (`ChainValidation{valid,
bad_index, reason}`), rather than continuing to scan — a compromised chain
is already unreliable past that point.

## 14. Tamper detection

Startup loads the chain and immediately runs `blockchain_validate`. A
validation failure at boot is a **warning, not a fatal error** — the program
still starts, so `validate chain`/`view records` can demonstrate the failure
interactively (this is what the assignment's demo explicitly requires: run
the program, then show validation reporting the compromise). What *is*
enforced is that `borrow`/`return` re-check chain integrity immediately
before writing and refuse if the chain is already compromised — otherwise a
new, perfectly valid-looking block appended on top of tampered history would
make the tamper harder to notice, not easier.

Six tamper variants are exercised in `tests/run_tests.sh`: a hashed field
changed, the stored hash changed directly, `previous_hash` changed, a genuine
single external byte flipped via script, a corrupted signature with the hash
left untouched, and a swapped-in wrong public key. All six are correctly
detected and reported with the specific block index and reason.

## 15. Error handling strategy

- **Fatal at startup** (exit 1, program does not proceed): missing/empty
  registry files, a chain file that doesn't even parse (shape-level
  corruption), inability to create/load the ECDSA keypair.
- **Non-fatal but flagged**: a chain that parses but fails cryptographic
  validation — reported loudly, writes disabled, reads still allowed.
- **Per-command, recoverable**: invalid book/member IDs, double
  borrow/return, unrecognized commands — a clear message, loop continues.
- Every fixed-size buffer copy uses `snprintf`/bounded `%Ns` scanning; every
  integer parsed from external input (`persistence.c`) uses `strtol` with
  full error checking, not `atoi`.

## 16. Testing

44 automated assertions in `tests/run_tests.sh` (`make test`), each in an
isolated sandbox, covering registries, borrow, return, blockchain structure,
cryptography (including two deliberately adversarial cases — a corrupted
signature and a wrong public key — not just "does the happy path work"),
six tamper variants, and one full AddressSanitizer/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer
session across every command. See `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` for the exact
requirement-to-test mapping. One real defect (an unbounded `strcpy` in the
chain validation loop) was caught by an R11.2 inspection pass during this
process and fixed before the checklist was marked complete.

## 17. Terminal output (see note)

The assignment asks for application screenshots. What follows are real
terminal transcripts captured from actual runs of the compiled binary during
development — not rendered image screenshots, and re-formatted with `$
command` lines for readability (the actual runs pipe commands into stdin
non-interactively, so the raw output interleaves differently); the message
text and ordering below is copied verbatim from the real runs, unedited.
Image captures for the final submission (and the demo video, which
supersedes static screenshots anyway) are still outstanding; see Limitations.

## 18. Challenges encountered and solutions

- **The `unsigned char[72]` signature field has no length field.** ECDSA P-256
  DER signatures are variable length (up to ~72 bytes), but nothing in the
  spec's struct tracks the actual length. Solution: added an in-memory-only
  `sig_len` field on `Block`, explicitly documented as not persisted and not
  hashed, so it doesn't change the spec-defined on-disk block shape — see
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `REQUIREMENTS.md` ambiguity #4.
- **Demonstrating tamper detection without breaking the demo flow.** An
  early version treated any validation failure at startup as fatal, which
  would prevent the program from even reaching the CLI to show `validate
  chain` reporting the failure live. Solution: startup failures are now a
  warning, not an exit — the program starts, reads still work, and writes
  are the thing actually blocked (see §14).
- **`localtime_r`/`strtok`-family POSIX functions not visible under
  `-std=c11`.** Strict C11 hides POSIX extensions by default under glibc.
  Solution: added `-D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L` to the Makefile's `CFLAGS`.
- **A `strcpy` slipped into the validation loop** despite the "no unsafe
  functions" rule, because both buffers happened to be safely bounded and it
  wasn't caught by compiler warnings. Found via a targeted `git grep` during
  the R11.2 check, replaced with `snprintf`. Documented in
  `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` rather than silently fixed with no record.

## 19. Limitations

- `OVERDUE` is a structurally valid action value but no due-date concept or
  triggering logic exists anywhere in the spec or this implementation —
  intentionally left unimplemented (see §4/ambiguity #3), not a bug.
- The registry arrays are fixed-size (256 entries); fine for the assignment's
  scale, would need to become dynamic for a larger deployment.
- No multi-user/concurrent-access handling — the CLI assumes a single
  process operating on the chain file at a time.
- Private key has no passphrase (simpler for a lab demo; a production system
  would want one).
- Demo video and rendered image screenshots are not yet produced (see
  `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` Deliverables — tracked, not silently dropped).

## 20. Conclusion

The system meets every functional requirement in the assignment (registries,
genesis/borrow/return/validate/view, SHA-256 linking, ECDSA signing, tamper
detection, file persistence, CLI, defensive error handling), verified by 44
passing automated tests rather than asserted from a read-through. The one
spec inconsistency found (attendance-chain wording) was flagged and resolved
explicitly rather than copied or silently altered. Remaining work is entirely
in the deliverables layer — pushing the repository, recording the demo video,
and (optionally) exporting rendered screenshots — not in the implementation
itself.
